# Databases
The data folder in the Database repository is used for the exercises 2-6.There is also one file in this folder which called reviews.csv and I have not upload it, because even zipped it's too large and github doesn't allow to upload so big files.

In the Project folder -> data, I had the same problem with the files credits.csv and ratings.csv

Both the Exercises and the Project were developed in collaboration with the fellow student
